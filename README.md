# Welcome to my Github!

Hi, this is Jacob Xu. I graduated from the University of Michigan (Go Blue! ðŸ˜Ž ) with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and two minors in Statistics and Mathematics. I am now pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University in Seattle.

My passion is to collaborate with talented people to create meaningful software products and services. Through my past work and project experiences as a software engineer (full-time and intern), I became well-versed in developing full-stack and serverless mobile/web applications. I am proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript (React/Redux) and familiar with cloud development services such as AWS and Heroku. I am always eager to learn more and challenge myself to higher standards.
